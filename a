I want to create a new web game: it will be a replica of Minecraft, but will run entirely in the browser. For now, I want it to be written in basic raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; the game itself will be extremely simple and single-player. To begin, I want to have a nice and elegant interface (similar to the real Minecraft's), where the first screen is "Singleplayer", "Multiplayer", "Options", and "Quit". Only the "Singleplayer" button should do anything for now: bring the user to a second page where they can create a world, and select the settings for it (for now, just a button "Create World" with no options).
I want you to fully develop and implement this. When a user loads a world, just have it show a blank screen for now, I will develop that later. Keep the number of files to a minimum, differentiate the HTML CSS and JavaScript properly, and no folders.
